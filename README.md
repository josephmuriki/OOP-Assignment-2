# OOP-Assignment-2
This project demonstrates the use of radio buttons to allow users to select an option from a set of mutually exclusive choices.
Creating an application that uses five radio buttons to let one choose which pet is to be displayed at a time.
Displays a message box with the selected option when the user clicks on a radio button.
The pets are Bird, Cat, Dog, Rabbit and Pig.
I have used the Visual Studio Code as my IDE in this project.
One can choose a particular pet and it will be displayed.
